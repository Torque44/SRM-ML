## Abstract 
The project of predicting rider-driven cancellations in advance will be useful for Shadowfax, a delivery company that works with clients such as Swiggy and Zomato. By being able to anticipate cancellations before they happen, Shadowfax can reassign orders to other riders and minimize delays or customer dissatisfaction, thereby increasing operational efficiency and customer satisfaction. The project will also be useful for other companies in the food delivery industry or any other industry that involves the delivery of goods, where cancellations can cause disruptions to the delivery process. By using the predictive model, these companies can optimize their operations and minimize the impact of cancellations on their business.
Moreover, the project can also be useful for data scientists and machine learning enthusiasts who are interested in working on predictive modelling problems. The project provides a practical example of how to approach such problems, including data collection, pre-processing, feature engineering, model selection, and evaluation. For example, if a rider is likely to cancel an order due to an unforeseen circumstance, the company can reassign the order to another rider who is available and willing to complete the delivery. This can help reduce delivery time, improve customer satisfaction, and increase the chances of repeat business.
The predictive model can also help companies identify the factors that contribute to cancellations, such as rider availability, order complexity, and traffic conditions. By analysing these factors, companies can adjust their operations and policies to reduce the likelihood of cancellations and improve their delivery services. Moreover, the project of predicting rider-driven cancellations in advance can be extended to other industries beyond the delivery industry. For example, in the healthcare industry, a predictive model can be developed to anticipate patient cancellations for appointments or surgeries, allowing healthcare providers to optimize their scheduling and reduce waiting times for patients.
